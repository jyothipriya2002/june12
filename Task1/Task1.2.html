        A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica. It originated from the region between
         northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India.[1][2] M. indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast 
         Asia since ancient times resulting in two types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian 
         type".[1][2] Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called "mangoes", the majority 
         of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.[3]Worldwide, there are several hundred cultivars of mango. Depending on the 
         cultivar, mango fruit varies in size, shape, sweetness, skin color, and flesh color, which may be pale yellow, gold, green, 
         or orange.[4] Mango is the national fruit of India, Pakistan and the Philippines,[5][6] while the mango tree is the national 
         tree of Bangladesh.[7]In deep soil.

        This article is about the fruit. For other uses, see Guava (disambiguation).Ripe apple guavas (Psidium guajava)Guava 
        (/ˈɡwɑːvə/ GWAH-və)[1] is a common tropical fruit cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions.[2] The common
        guava Psidium guajava (lemon guava, apple guava) is a small tree in the myrtle family (Myrtaceae), native to Mexico,
        Central America, the Caribbean and northern South America.[2] The name guava is also given to some other species in
        the genus Psidium such as strawberry guava (Psidium cattleyanum) and to the pineapple guava, Feijoa sellowiana. 
        In 2019, 55 million tonnes of guavas were produced worldwide, led by India with 45% of the total. Botanically,
         guavas are berries.

        The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa)[1] is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus 
        Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit. The fruit is widely 
        appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large 
        quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates. 
        Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in products such as candy, soap, lip gloss,
        perfume, and many others.

        The pineapple is a herbaceous perennial, which grows to 1.0 to 1.5 m (3 ft 3 in to 4 ft 11 in) tall on average,
         although sometimes it can be taller. The plant has a short, stocky stem with tough, waxy leaves. When creating 
         its fruit, it usually produces up to 200 flowers, although some large-fruited cultivars can exceed this. Once 
         it flowers, the individual fruits of the flowers join together to create a multiple fruit. After the first 
         fruit is produced, side shoots (called 'suckers' by commercial growers) are produced in the leaf axils of the
         main stem. These suckers may be removed for propagation, or left to produce additional fruits on the original
        plant.[5] Commercially, suckers that appear around the base are cultivated. It has 30 or more narrow, fleshy,

        Commercial cherries are obtained from cultivars of several species, such as the sweet Prunus avium and the sour 
        Prunus cerasus. The name 'cherry' also refers to the cherry tree and its wood, and is sometimes applied to almonds
         and visually similar flowering trees in the genus Prunus, as in "ornamental cherry" or "cherry blossom." Wild 
         cherry may refer to any of the cherry species growing outside cultivation, although Prunus avium is often 
         referred to specifically by the name "wild cherry" in the British Isles.
